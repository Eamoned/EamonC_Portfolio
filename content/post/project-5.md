* There are many devices that record key fitness performance metrics making it possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity. Usually the goal is to measure regularly so to improve fitness, health and find new patterns in behaviour.
* One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. This project will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal of this project is to predict, using Trees, Boosting and Random Forest, the manner in which they did the exercises.
