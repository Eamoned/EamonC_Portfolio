title: "Exploratory Data Analysis of Sales Data"
---

* For many businesses to remain competitive it's critical that they leverage data analysis and AL/ML to improve their forecasting and future sales models. This usually involves the analyse of historical sales data, exploring customer demand, analysing the competition, seasonality patterns, the effect of holidays and promotions, and much more.
* The objective of this project is twofold. To carry out analysis of the actual dataset in order to determine the characteristics of the features, reliability of the data, critical detail and any weaknesses and/or missing data in the dataset. The second goal of the project is to explore the data in order o gain new information and insights wherever possible. This analysis includes some feature engineering allowing data to be transformed into more meaningful information and sales insights.  
* This Sales data is analysed using Python and Jupyter Notebook web application. This allows you to create & share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations and narrative text.
* Of course Data Analysis would only be the first step for any business. This is usually followed by building predictive models for forecasting future sales involving additional steps such as feature selection, model building and finally deployment.
