Then select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to and using this information, establish high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
* The analysis, insights gained and subsequent recommendations are based on the analysis of the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset.
