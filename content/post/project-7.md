title: "Python Libraries for Visualsation"
---

* There are many python visualisation libraries available to plot scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps and histograms. Some can be a little more sophisticated and interactive than others but it really comes down to what's appropriate for the project and your visualisation requirements, i.e. a static chart may be suffice or maybe something more interactive is required.
* There are of course many other options, like Boheh, Pygal and Altair, to name just a few. In this jupyter notebook I illustrate just a few examples which I use quite often for my EDA projects.
