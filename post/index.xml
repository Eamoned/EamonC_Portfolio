      <description>For many businesses to remain competitive it&amp;rsquo;s critical that they leverage data analysis and AL/ML to improve their forecasting and future sales models. This usually involves the analyse of historical sales data, exploring customer demand, analysing the competition, seasonality patterns, the effect of holidays and promotions, and much more. The objective of this project is twofold. To carry out analysis of the actual dataset in order to determine the characteristics of the features, reliability of the data, critical detail and any weaknesses and/or missing data in the dataset.</description>

      <description>This machine learning application predicts which employees are more likely to stay or quit the business. Using models to predict if a staff member is likely to quit can support HR&amp;rsquo;s ability to be proactive and to take actions to prevent or at least minimise the probability of the employee leaving. Simply input some details and the app will make a prediction and it&amp;rsquo;s probability. This application is built with Python &amp;amp; deployed using streamlit and Heroku.</description>

      <description>Check out this machine learning interactive application that predicts the strength of concrete using different models. Choose from different Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) options, apply feature engineering, and tweak a few hyperparameters tuning options. Test the various models and determine their accuracy. This application is deployed using streamlit, a versatile interactive open source framework ideal for model exploration and machine learning applications.

      <title>Python Libraries for Visualisation</title>
      <link>https://eamoned.github.io/EamonC_Portfolio/post/project-7/</link>

      <description>There are many python visualisation libraries available to plot scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps and histograms. Some can be a little more sophisticated and interactive than others but it really comes down to what&amp;rsquo;s appropriate for the project and your visualisation requirements, i.e. a static chart may be suffice or maybe something more interactive is required. There are of course many other options, like Boheh, Pygal and Altair, to name just a few.</description>

      <description>There are many devices that record key fitness performance metrics making it possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity. Usually the goal is to measure regularly so to improve fitness, health and find new patterns in behaviour. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. This project will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants.</description>
