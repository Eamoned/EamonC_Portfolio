      <description>There are many python visualisation libraries available to plot scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps and histograms. Some can be a little more sophisticated and interactive than others but it really comes down to what&amp;rsquo;s appropriate for the project and your visualisation requirements, i.e. a static chart may be suffice or maybe something more interactive is required. There are of course many other options, like Boheh, Pygal and Altair, to name just a few.</description>

      <description>There are many devices that record key fitness performance metrics making it possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity. Usually the goal is to measure regularly so to improve fitness, health and find new patterns in behaviour. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. This project will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants.</description>
