title: "Human Resources Attrition Prediction App"
---

* This machine learning application predicts which employees are more likely to stay or quit the business.
* Using models to predict if a staff member is likely to quit can support HR's ability to be proactive and to take actions to prevent or at least minimise the probability of the employee leaving.
* Simply input some details and the app will make a prediction and it's probability.
* This application is built with Python & deployed using streamlit and Heroku.
